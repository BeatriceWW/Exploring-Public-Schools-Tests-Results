# Exploring-Public-Schools-Tests-Results

Every year, American high school students take the SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. The SATs have three sections: reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they are pivotal in admissions.

Analyzing school performance is important for various stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, the government, and even parents who are considering which school their children should attend.
